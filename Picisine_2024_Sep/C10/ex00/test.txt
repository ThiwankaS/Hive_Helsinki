There are 30 passages in each levelâ€”90 passages altogether. Start reading at Level I. If the
passages seem too easy, move to Level II.
If you need help reading challenging words, use Passages to Reading with the software
program Developing Reading Fluency (Attainment Company, 2014). Developing Reading
Fluency shows you how to break multisyllabic words into parts that are easier to read.
Developing Reading Fluency also shows you how to break sentences into phrases making
reading easier.
